The notification trigger is a specified period of time after a starting event, which may be enrolment in the course, completing an activity, or other course variables.
Notifications can be set to repeat for a limited run, and/or until the target activity is completed, and can have delay periods between repeats.
If the user has already completed the target activity, no email is sent.

You could use this plugin to: <ul>
<li>Selectively release timed content in a course.</li>
<li>Repeatedly remind students that an assignment is overdue.</li>
<li>Advise training managers that the course is complete.</li>
</ul>

The Reengagement activity is very flexible, explore what you can do with it.
